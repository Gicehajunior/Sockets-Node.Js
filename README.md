# Web Socket
Web Socket is a protocol which provides a full duplex(multiway) communication i.e allows communication in both directions simultaneously. It is a modern web technology in which there is a continuous connection between the userâ€™s browser(client) and the server. In this type of communication, between the web server and the web browser, both of them can send messages to each other at any point in time. Traditionally in the web, we had a request/response format where a user sends an HTTP request and server responds to that.
